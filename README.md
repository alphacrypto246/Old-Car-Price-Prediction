Old Car Price Prediction
Overview
The Old Car Price Prediction project aims to leverage machine learning techniques to accurately predict the prices of used cars based on various influential features. As the used car market continues to grow, this project provides valuable insights for both buyers and sellers, helping them make informed decisions.

Project Goals
The primary goal is to build a predictive model that can estimate the market value of old cars. The model considers factors such as:

Mileage: Total distance driven by the car.
Age: The number of years since the car was manufactured.
Brand and Model: The make and specific model of the vehicle.
Condition: Physical state, including exterior and interior conditions, accident history, and service records.
By analyzing these features, the project aims to create an accurate pricing model that reflects market trends.

Methodology
The project employs a structured approach:

Data Collection: Gather a comprehensive dataset containing historical prices and relevant features of old cars.
Data Preprocessing: Clean the dataset by handling missing values and converting categorical variables into numerical formats.
Model Selection: Implement both Linear Regression and Polynomial Regression models to evaluate which method better captures the relationship between features and prices.
Evaluation: Assess model performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared values. Visualizations of predictions compared to actual prices help in understanding model accuracy.
Visualization
Graphical representations illustrate the differences in predictions from linear and polynomial regression models, highlighting how well each model performs against actual data points.
