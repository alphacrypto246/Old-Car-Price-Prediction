# Old Car Price Prediction

This project aims to predict the resale price of used cars based on various features such as age, mileage, fuel type, and more. The model uses machine learning techniques to provide accurate price predictions, helping buyers and sellers make informed decisions.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing values, categorical variables, and feature scaling.
- **Machine Learning Model**: Trained to predict car prices based on historical data.
- **Visualization**: Displays trends and relationships between features and car prices.
- **Customizable**: Easily extendable to include additional features or use different models.

## Libraries Used
The following libraries are used in this project:

- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization.
- **Seaborn**: For enhanced data visualization.
- **scikit-learn**: For implementing and evaluating machine learning models.

## Requirements
To run the project, you need the following dependencies:

```bash
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
```

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/alphacrypto246/Old-Car-Price-Prediction.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Old-Car-Price-Prediction
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook file `main.ipynb`.
2. Load the dataset by following the instructions in the notebook.
3. Run the cells sequentially to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.
4. Visualize the results and interpret the predictions.

## File Structure
- `main.ipynb`: The main notebook containing the implementation of the model.
- `data/`: Folder to store the dataset (not included in the repository).
- `README.md`: Project documentation.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies.

## Dataset
Ensure you have access to a dataset with features like:
- Car Age
- Mileage
- Fuel Type
- Transmission Type
- Selling Price

You can source datasets from platforms like Kaggle or other automotive datasets.

## Results
The project demonstrates the ability of machine learning models to accurately predict used car prices based on input features. Visualizations of feature importance and price trends are included.
